# Envirosocial Complexity 

# Complejidad social aplicada a medio ambiente?

Segun lo indicado por el Centro de COmplejidad Social de la Geroge Mason University (https://socialcomplexity.gmu.edu/)
su centro de investigacion aborda la complejidad social desde la interdisciplinariedad que comprende investigación, descubrimientos, invenciones que apoyen la exploracion y el analisis de fenomenos sociales humanos. En este centro se enfocan en explotar las interacciones sinergicas entre investigacion teórica y investigacion de política aplicada. 

Tienen un paper que habla de Desarrollo sustentable en medio de riesgos de inundacion.
Antes de ver un ejemplo de paper, veamos qué son las ciencias sociales computacionales y qué relacion tienen con la complejidad social.

Segun Claudio Ciofﬁ-Revilla (Computational social science, 2010):
### La ciencia social computacional es un campo interdisciplinario en la intersección de las ciencias sociales, la ciencia computacional y la ciencia de la complejidad.
The social sciences investigate human and social dynamics and organization at alllevels of analysis (consilience), including cognition, decision making, behavior, groups, organizations, societies, and the world system. Computational socialscience is the integrated, interdisciplinary pursuit of social inquiry with emphasison information processing and through the medium of advanced computation.The main computational social science areas are automated information extractionsystems, social network analysis, social geographic information systems (GIS),complexity modeling, and social simulation models


Aunque es joven según los estándares históricos, la ciencia social computacional ya cubre muchas áreas y temas que anteriormente estaban más allá del ámbito de la investigación científica en las dinámicas humanas y sociales, como lo ilustra la creciente literatura.

### The social sciences or social science disciplines investigate all forms of human and social dynamics and organization at all levels of analysis (or‘consilience,’2), including cognition, decision making, behavior,groups,organizations,societies,andtheworldsystem.

**The traditional social science disciplines are ﬁve: social psychology, anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology, each of which comprises several specialized branches.**




Assessing and mapping human well-being for sustainable development amid flood hazards: Poyang Lake Region of China




## Abstract

  Less developed places that are affected by climatic impacts face great challenges to future development. 

  Place-based assessments that look at both the development level and climatic impacts on development are important for understanding the current state of human well-being and generating insights into how to facilitate sustainable development in the future. 

  **We carry out an assessment of human well-being in the Poyang Lake Region of China (PLR), using GIS, remote sensing, and socio-economic data.** 

  We measure human well-being in three aspects of (i) development level, (ii) exposure of development to flooding, and (iii) sensitivity of development to flooding. 

  Following the **United Nations Development Programme's human development index**, we examine *development* through measures of *life expectancy, literacy, and income*. 

  We first use a digital elevation model and GIS data on levees to map flood hazard in PLR. Based on the flood hazard map, we then derive quantitative measures of exposure and sensitivity of the development in a town to flooding. 

  Our assessment indicates that **development in PLR overall is highly exposed and sensitive to flooding**. 

  *There are significant variations in different aspects of human wellbeing among the 298 towns in the region.*

  *These variations suggest different sustainable development pathways and policy interventions for different places*.

  **We discuss the potential usefulness of our approach for other similar places.** (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

 # Abstract

**Social complexity** and **sustainability** emerge from *successful problem solving*, ***rather than directly from environmental conditions.***

Social complexity develops from problem solving at all scales from local to national and international. 

**Complexity in problem solving is an economic function, and can both support and hinder sustainability.** 

*Sustainability outcomes may take decades or centuries to develop.* 

Historical *studies reveal three outcomes to long-term change in problem-solving institutions:* **collapse, resiliency through simplification, or continuity based on growing complexity and increasing energy subsidies.** 

***The slow development of complexity in problem solving makes its effects difficult to perceive, especially over short time periods.***

**Long-term social sustainability depends on understanding and controlling complexity.** New strategies to mitigate or control complexity are offered.

## Challenges of ecological complexity
February 2004Ecological Complexity 1(1):3-6
Abstract
Complexity poses enormous challenges in ecology. In order to study complexity or factor it into our theories or mod-els, a better understanding of complexity is needed. Complexity has at least six dimensions in ecology: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric. These six sources of complexity are discussed. Issues and approaches to the study of complexity are also discussed. It is argued that our vocabulary for describing complexity is deficient in many ar-eas. Scaling is a successful technique that has been used to simplify complex relationships. Model reduction is shown to be a powerful technique that applies when either ensembles of objects behave as aggregate wholes or conservation laws constrain overall behaviors. It is argued that experimental frames need more attention when dealing with complex ecosys-tem attributes. Life history theory and metapopulation models are two areas where further development of the subject de-pends on the ability to handle complexity properly. It is concluded that explicit study of complexity is both necessary and timely.
